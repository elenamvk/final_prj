#Final project: :guitar::sleeping::sparkles: TourCouch app :guitar::sleeping::sparkles:

##Preparation:

  > Pick a problem and solve it using web dev means: google-fu, class-notes, teamworking and your tutors.

###Scope:

> FOR: -> touring-europe bands on the cheap
> WHO: -> are looking for a friendly couch to crash on
> OUR BRAND IS: -> musicians-friendly houses from discreet fans with a couch to spare
> THAT: -> previous clereance of the band's merit, provide a sleeping place to bands on tour
> BY: -> advertising the bands' need on a private house-owners-fans/bands-only-wall, the house-owners being able
> to interact in a further private part of the website
> BECAUSE: -> this ensures privacy and a comfortable place for a band, and to the house owner a verified bunch of
> hosts for an evening.
  
###MVP:
 
    access either as a band or as a house owner
    1st layer: a private board: band creates message asking for house, house owner answers
    2nd layer: a private forum about every single band (alphabet order) (every band is a message, house owner comment upon)
    band profile: calendar showing tour dates (manually modified)
    house profile: calendar showing booked house dates (manually modified)

##Special mention: free tutorials & the community

I resolved not to bither my tutors too much about my project - so I really owe much of my website to the community. Thank you, to everyone that took two minutes to answer something on stackoverflow, or two more minutes to create a tutorial about it.
